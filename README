# Outline

- Basic concepts
  - Linking and namespaces, `nm`
  - Name mangling and `extern "C"`

- Basic FFI
  - Shared libraries, manual lookup
    - `ctypes`
    - I will be using Python, but this style is most
      useful if you are providing bindings for multiple
      languages

- Language-specific tools (`Python.h`, `pybind11`, etc.)

- Common concerns
  - Error handling
  - Cross-language memory management
  - Converting between idioms (e.g. out parameters)

- General frameworks (SWIG)
  - Powerful, but usually lower quality than something hand-written
